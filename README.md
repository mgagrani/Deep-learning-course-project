# Deep-learning-course-project

This repository contains the code for implementing the ADMM based pruning of weights of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
Please find the project details at https://arash1902.gitlab.io/deepee_memeff_fpga/

Following is the file description:

1. main.py - Code for the conventional training pipeline of a CNN to obtain the baseline model.
2. main_admm.py - Code for the ADMM training routine. 
3. main_retrain.py - Code for the retraining of the model obtained after ADMM based training.
